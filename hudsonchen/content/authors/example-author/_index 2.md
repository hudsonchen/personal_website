## About

I am a first year Ph.D. candidate at the Center of Foundational Artificial Intelligence of University College London, supervised by 
Fran√ßois-Xavier Briol and Arthur Gretton.


My research interests center around probabilistic modelling and causal inference.
I am generally interested in statistical machine learning. More specifically, I am currently working on approximate
inference, kernel methods, graphical models, etc. 



## Bio
I obtained the bachelor's degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering

I have worked as a research assistant at Oxford Applied and Theoretical Machine Learning Group (OATML), advised by Yarin Gal. 
I have also worked as a research assistant at Statistics and Machine Learning group at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), 
advised by Tong Zhang.
